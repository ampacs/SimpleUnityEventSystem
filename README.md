# Simple Unity Event System

Located at `Events/`

Provides a simple Event System, where events need to be defined at `Events/Types` as `public const string`. Example events are provided.
Events which are not defined as such cannot be used to trigger behaviour. This forces any events to always be properly defined, and at a central location.
